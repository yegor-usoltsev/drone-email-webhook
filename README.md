Drone CI / CD plugin to trigger builds for a list of downstream repositories.

## Usage

TODO

## Docker Images

The plugin is delivered as a multi-platform Docker image and is available for download from two image registries of
choice: [yusoltsev/drone-email-webhook](https://hub.docker.com/r/yusoltsev/drone-email-webhook)
and [ghcr.io/yegor-usoltsev/drone-email-webhook](https://github.com/yegor-usoltsev/drone-email-webhook/pkgs/container/drone-email-webhook).
Images are tagged as follows:

- `latest` - Tracks the latest released version, which is typically tagged with a version number. This tag is
  recommended for most users as it provides the most stable version.
- `edge` - Tracks the latest commits to the `main` branch.
- `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v1.0.1`) - Represents a specific released version.
